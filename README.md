# PokemonAPI

Playing about with Python, Flask, and JSON files.

You can clone and launch the API if you have Flask installed.

http://127.0.0.1/<id> --> Returns the name of a pokemon

http://127.0.0.1/height/<id> --> Returns the height of a pokemon

http://127.0.0.1/weight/<id> --> Returns the weight of a pokemon

http://127.0.0.1/base_experience/<id> --> Returns the base experience of a pokemon

For instance, 'CURL -X GET http://127.0.0.1/1' will return 'Bulbasaur'.
